# SortManager Project by Reshman Siva

## What is SortManager?

SortManager is a project that I (Reshman) have coded to experiment with different sorting algorithms. 

As of 17th December 2021 it contains 3 sorting algorithms (binary tree, bubble sort, and merge sort), however more sorting algorithms may be added in future updates.
The project can be used to sort a randomly generated number of user defined array size via any of the currently existing sorting algorithms that are implemented. The project also has a performanceTest class to compare the speed sorting algorithms against one another.

## Latest updates
* 17/12/2021 - Functioning merge sort algorithm implemented
* 15/12/2021 - Functioning binary tree algorithm implemented
* 13/12/2021 - Functioning bubble sort algorithm implemented

## Future improvements

When I have some time I plan on coming back to the project to add a quicksort algorithm and an insertion sort algorithm.

## Bug reporting

If you come across a bug with my project please feel free to email me with details on how to reproduce the bug to reshmansiva96@gmail.com.
